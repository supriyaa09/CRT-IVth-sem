## 🐍 Python Environment

This project uses a virtual environment located in `.venv/`. To activate:

```bash
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Language Fundamentals**: Variables, operators, data types
- **Control Structures**: Conditionals, loops, loop control
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, lists, basic collections
- **Logic Building**: Problem-solving patterns and algorithms
- **Pattern Programming**: Console-based pattern generation
- **Comprehensions**: List, set, and dictionary comprehensions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Run any Python file using:
   ```bash
